## About the project

### Internal implementation

- To work with json, the project uses a popular library [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- The Winsock C++ library is used to work with the server.

### Runtime

- You just need to enter the name and the game and the bot will do everything for you.

## Creating a project using CMake
### Command Line / Terminal required
Create a folder build in Geschwader:
```
> mkdir build
```
Now go to our `Geschwader/build` folder and issue the following command to generate a project using CMake:
```
> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
```
## Compiling the code and testing bot
Now once the project is created, we can easily compile it from the console from the build directory using the command:
```
> cmake --build .
```
Open the `build\CMakeBot\Debug` folder and type the following command for launch server:
```
> CMakeBot.exe
```

Now you can enter the name and game and start the bot.
